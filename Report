\section{Introduction and Motivation}
In today's world of mass communication and information transfer, understanding transmission has never been more important. Within the last century, developments have allowed instantaneous exchanges from people at opposite ends of the world: simply unprecedented in history.  This has allowed for rapid advancement of technology and society as a whole.  Though it may sound like an oversimplification, the basic coaxial cable may be the backbone of this fairly recent infrastructure. \\

Coaxial cable (sometimes called coax) has been around since its discovery by Heaviside in the late 1800's.  Since then, it has been relied upon for transmission in all sorts of industries: including cable television, radio, and the internet.  Coax is known to send its pulses using electromagnetic fluctuations in the form of transverse waves. \\

Since coax relies upon electromagnetic waves to send signals, it should obey a wave equation.  This wave equation should be similar to the one that models the classical transverse wave,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}=\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation} 
where f is the vertical displacement, x is the horizontal position, v is the phase velocity, and t is time. In this experiment, I will be testing if a coaxial cable will behave as a 2nd order, partial, differential wave equation predicts. \\

If successful, this model can be applied to any situation where coaxial cable is used as an electrical transmitter. This would give further insight into behaviors like wave reflection and transmission. Ultimately, the model could allow better optimization of cables and receivers, which would yield more accurate communication and information transfer.  

\section{Model}
Coaxial cable is designed around a central inner wire transmitting the main signal.  The wire (typically made from copper) is immediately surrounded by an insulating dielectric (to prevent interference). Surrounding the dielectric is a flexible metallic sheath that functions as a ground.  Lastly, the entire wire is enclosed in a plastic (PVC) jacket to further prevent external influence (see Figure 1 below).

Though there are different varieties of coax cable (different materials for insulator, jacket, etc), they all have the same basic layout.  Therefore, all types of cable share common characteristics. \\

To begin, each cable has inherent resistance.  Though this value is usually very small, it can still have an impact on the signal, especially over great distances.  For smaller distances, the resistance can occasionally be neglected.  Coax cable also has two charged sources with different potentials (the inner and outer conductive wires).  As the wires are separated by a dielectric, there is a given capacitance for each length of the cable. Due to the alternating current passing through the cable, the magnetic flux isn't constant in the wire.  Therefore, there is inductance present as well.  Finally, the dielectric insulator is innately imperfect; often a small amount of current can pass from the inner wire to the outer sheath.\\

Each of these voltage drops take place over the entire length of the cable. This means that each infinitesimal length of cable, there is a circuit that can be constructed:\\

\subsection{Deriving a Voltage Wave Equation}
In the above figure, the resistance is R, the inductance L, the capacitance C, and dielectric conductance, G.  The upper wire is the inner wire of the cable, with the lower wire as the sheath.  All of these quantities can create a voltage drop across a stretch of cable; Kirchoff's voltage loop rule can be applied:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i = 0 = V_R + V_L + \Delta V
\end{equation}  
This states that the net gain or drop in voltage (V) around a circular loop of current is always zero.  In the circuit, the voltage drop occurs with $V_r$, $V_L$, and $\Delta V$(the combined voltage drop from the capacitance and dielectric conductance). Using Ohm's Law ($\Delta V = IR$) and Faraday's law for inductors ($\Delta V = L \frac{dI}{dt}$), the voltage drop for each component can be calculated.  As this occurs at an infinitesimal level, the applied loop rule can be rewritten as: 

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i = 0 = (IR + LI_t)\delta x + \delta V
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ denotes a small change. The t subscript on the current term I, indicates a partial derivative with respect to time. Equation 3 then can be simplified to:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i = 0 = IR + LI_t + V_x
\end{equation}
where the x subscript on the voltage term indicates a partial derivative with respect to position.  \\

A similar method can be used to solve for the current component of each minuscule device. Kirchoff's loop rule for current dictates that the sum of currents in conductors meeting at a point is equal to zero:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i = 0 = I_C + I_R + \Delta I
\end{equation}
By using Ohm's Law and the voltage-capacitance relation for current, Equation 5 can be matched to the scenario for coax cable:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i = 0 = CV_t + GV + I_x
\end{equation}
with the subscripts t and x denoting the same as in the voltage case.  By taking the partial x derivative of equation 4 and the partial t derivative of equation 6, two second order PDEs are given:
\begin{equation}
0 = I_xR + LI_{tx} + V_{xx}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
0 = CV_{tt} + GV_t + I_{xt}
\end{equation}
By substituting Equations 6 and 8 into Equation 7, each of the current terms can be eliminated:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{LC}V_{xx} = V_{tt} + (\Gamma + \frac{G}{C})V_t + \frac{RG}{LC}V
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is $\frac{R}{L}$.  For most situations, the conductance of the dielectric material is extremely small.  Equation 9 simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{LC}V_{xx} = V_{tt} + \Gamma V_t
\end{equation}
Depending on the accuracy needed for the model, damping or attenuation may or may not need to be taken into account.  The damping of this coax circuit is primarily caused by the resistance term of $\Gamma$.  $\Gamma$ is called the dampening coefficient of the system. In the event of small attenuation (theoretically a reasonable approximation given the small resistance of coax cable) Equation 10 is simplified even further (and converted back to Leibniz notation):

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t^2}=\frac{1}{LC}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation} 
This closely resembles the original, known wave equation (Equation 1).  Using the analogy to the wave equation, Equation 11  implies that the wave propagation speed through coaxial cable is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$. \\
\subsection{An Idealized Solution For Wave Coefficients}
As mentioned in the introduction, a useful description of wave behavior is expressed in terms of reflection and transmission of the transverse wave.  Transmission and reflection of the original wave pulse occurs due to a boundary interrupting the wave path. Transmission is the portion of the wave that moves across the boundary; reflection is the portion that bounces back and adds itself to the incident wave.  The transmission and reflection waves typically differ in amplitude from the original wave.  The amplitudes for each wave are expressed by the coefficients, A (incident wave), B (reflected wave), and C (transmitted wave). The reflection coefficient R and transmission coefficient T are defined as the amplitude ratios of their respective waves to the incident:

\begin{equation}
R \equiv \frac{B}{A};\quad T \equiv  \frac{C}{A}
\end{equation}
\indent To predict values for both of these coefficients, the differential coax wave equation can be solved.  In this case, the classical string example will be solved (Equation 1), with analogs utilized to convert the results for a coaxial voltage wave.  The solutions to the wave equation are:
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{inc} (x,t) = A\sin (kx-\omega t); 
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{ref} (x,t) = B\sin (-kx-\omega t);
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{trans} (x,t) = C\sin (k'x-\omega t)
\end{equation}
\indent For a transverse wave hitting a boundary, all three pieces of the wave must be continuous.  This means that the physical position of the combined incident and reflected wave must match with the position of the transmitted wave. Setting the boundary at $x=0$, this is shown as $\Psi_{inc}(0,t)+\Psi_{ref}(0,t)=\Psi_{trans}(0,t)$.  After applying this boundary condition, an equation relating the amplitudes can be derived:
\begin{equation}
C = A + B
\end{equation} 
A second boundary condition can be applied, as the slopes of the waves must match as well as the position for the waves to be truly continuous.  By differentiating Equations 13-15 and applying a similar rationale as the other condition, an equation relating the wave vectors (k) is found:
\begin{equation}
k(A - B)=k'C
\end{equation} 
\indent By rearranging Equation 17 and substituting in Equation 16, two equations relating the reflection and transmission coefficients can be found:
\begin{equation}
R=\frac{B}{A}=\frac{k-k'}{k+k'}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{C}{A}=\frac{2k}{k+k'}
\end{equation} 
\indent In using the relationship between a voltage coaxial wave and a classical string system, it is possible to rewrite the two above equations. As the electrical analog to a wavevector is the circuit impedence (Z), the two equations can be altered to:
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{B}{A}=\frac{Z-Z'}{Z+Z'}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T = \frac{C}{A}=\frac{2Z}{Z+Z'}
\end{equation}
Impedance, interpreted as complex resistance ($\frac{V}{I}$), is generally a straightforward quantity to measure, which makes it a more useful form of the coefficients. The conversion of k to Z is possible because of the interpretation of voltage as the analog to force in the original wave equation (under constant tension).  Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
V_{ext}=Z\bigg(\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}\bigg) \Leftrightarrow F_{ext}=Z\bigg(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\bigg)
\end{equation}

\subsection{A Refined Solution for Waves with Attenuation}
However, Equations 20 and 21 rely upon no damping established in the circuit.  The analog established between force and voltage related Equation 11 to Equation 1; Equation 11 assumed no damping.  To determine wave coefficients incorporating the possible attenuation, the derived damped voltage wave equation (Equation 10) is solved. The solution will be of the form:
\begin{equation}
V(x,t)=Ae^i(kx-\omega t)
\end{equation}
After inputting the ansatz back into the differential equation, k is solved for using a $(1+z)^p$ Taylor expansion. 
\begin{equation}
k\approx \pm \frac{\omega}{v}\bigg(1+\frac{i\Gamma}{2\omega}\bigg)
\end{equation} 
In the event of weak damping (an underdamped oscillator: $\Gamma \ll 1$), k can be broken down into real and imaginary parts:
\begin{equation}
Re(k)=\pm \frac{\omega}{v}; \quad Im(k)=\pm \frac{\Gamma}{2v}
\end{equation}
However, the real part ($\frac{\omega}{v}$) is just k, the same as in the ideal model. The resulting voltage wave equation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
V(x,t) = Ae^{\frac{-\Gamma}{2v}x} e^{i(\frac{\omega}{v}x-\omega t)}
\end{equation}
If the second exponential term in the expression above is rewritten in terms of sines and cosines, it matches the undamped voltage wave equation (Equation 13).  Therefore, the `ideal' model is the same as the rigorous damped model, with the absence of a decay term, $e^{\frac{-\Gamma}{2v}x}$. For simplification, the value of the exponential ($\frac{-\Gamma}{2v}x$) is written as $\beta$. Written out explicitly:

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{R}{2vZ^2C} = \frac{RCv}{2}
\end{equation}
where R and C are the resistance and capacitance per unit length, with v being the speed of propagation (both are the same as used previously). Finally, with the dampening factor $\beta$, the attenuation factor can be applied to both the reflection and transmission coefficients. The two coefficients are:
\begin{equation}
R_{att} = -Re^{2\beta L}
\end{equation}    
\begin{equation}
T_{att} = \frac{Z'}{Z} Te^{-\beta L}
\end{equation}
\section{Methods}
To test if a wave equation derived from Kirchoff's laws could accurately depict coaxial behavior, the reflection and transmission coefficients were to be calculated experimentally. These could then be compared to the theory: both with and without attenuation.
